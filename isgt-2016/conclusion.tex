We developed an open source software and hardware framework for visualizing PQ events and information while maintaining usersâ€™ privacy. We performed a pilot study on both our hardware and software by deploying sensors across Oahu and aggregating and visualizing data using OPQHub. Our pilot study showed strong correlations between PV output and voltage fluctuations. We showed several severe events that were localized to a household and not a grid wide event. This indicates that our framework can differentiate between localized and grid-wide PQ events.

In the next version of OPQHub we intend to solidify our privacy controls by providing the ability to share data with trusted partners by adding the ability to define collections of OPQBoxes that provide specific privacy controls on those collections. Thus, users will be able to control their privacy at the individual level and at the level of groups of individuals.  Further, we intend to make a fully reactive user-interface for filtering and querying, build upon our grid based interface, and support a larger selection of PQ event types. Our next PQ meter OPQBox2 aims to be IEEE 1159 compliant, with optional GPS synchronization, and battery backup.
